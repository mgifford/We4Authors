What if the content management system you are using could produce accessibility by default? Or give you advanced support in publishing accessible content?

This is your chance to contribute to innovative solutions for the next generation accessible authoring.

In the EU-funded research project WE4Authors Cluster, market-leading web authoring tool providers are creating by-default accessibility features to help web authors in their content creation. During the autumn, Funka (project lead) will perform user tests with web authors to validate that the new features solve relevant problems, are easy to use, and work well.

The testing will be performed online and you will have the opportunity to impact the results of the project while learning more about accessible publishing. The project results are going to be free for all to use and the aim is for all market players to implement the features in their tools. This means that you will be able to require better accessibility support in your content management system.

The user testing is planned for October and each test will take approximately one hour. You are welcome to contribute once or during the whole iteration, and we are very keen to know your views on the features after the test.

Please contact Jakob Hasslöw if you would like to participate and contribute to better accessibility support in authoring tools: <a href="mailto:Jakob.Hasslow@funka.com">Jakob.Hasslow@funka.com</a>.
