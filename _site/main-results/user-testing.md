The extensive user testing performed with web authors from across Europe finished by the end of January 2021. We would like to thank all of you who have spent your time participating in the user tests and supporting the Cluster project! The consortium is right now analysing the test results and performing qualitative interviews to make sure the solutions we present are efficient, easy to use and implementable.
