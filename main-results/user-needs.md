In the first phase of the project, we analysed the results from the pilot project and reached out to stakeholders to gather indepth user requirements, focusing on the web author perspective. The information gathering was made using three main methods:

- Online survey
- Market input and analyse from pilot project WE4Authors workshop
- Deep discussions with project partners and senior advisor.

The major findings and conclusions of the results of the analysis and online survey show that user requirements can be divided into four categories with varying level of automation:

- Full automation
- Accessibility prompts
- Instructions and support
- Testing of accessibility
