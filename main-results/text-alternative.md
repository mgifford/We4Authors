summary: Presentation, video, and technical specification for the text alternative feature.
---

A text alternative (ALT-text) describes a visual element in words. It is essential for people using screen readers, who only perceive images through text that can be spoken or presented in braille.

The feature can support web authors when uploading an image by:

- prompting or requiring them to provide ALT-text
- giving clear guidance on when and how to write useful ALT-texts
- offering AI-generated suggested ALT-texts that authors can adjust
