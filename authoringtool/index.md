# Would you like to try out new accessibility features in authoring tools?

What if the content management system you are using could produce accessibility by default? Or give you advanced support in publishing accessible content?

This is your chance to contribute to innovative solutions for the next generation accessible authoring tool.

In the EU-funded research project WE4Authors Cluster, market leading web authoring tool providers are creating by default accessibility features to help web authors in their content creation. During the autumn, Funka, who is leading the project, are going to perform user tests with web authors to validate that the new features are solving relevant problems, easy to use and well working.

The testing will be performed online and you will have the opportunity to impact the results of the project at the same time as you will be inspired and learn more about accessible publishing.

The project results are going to be free for all to use and the aim is for all market players to implement the features in their tools. This means that you, in the near future, will hopefully be able to require better accessibility support in your content management system.

The user testing is planned for October and each test will take approximately one hour. You are welcome to contribute once or during the whole iteration and we are of course very keen to know your views on the features after the test.

To participate or ask questions, please open an issue on the project repository: [We4Authors issues](https://github.com/mgifford/We4Authors/issues).
