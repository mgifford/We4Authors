# Video interview

## WE4Authors Cluster on AXSChat

AXSChat is an open online community dedicated to creating an inclusive world.

By mid-July, the AXSChat community invited We4Authors Cluster partners Susanna Laurin (Funka), Timo Stollenwerk (KitConcept) and Mike Gifford (Open Concept) to chat with the community about default accessibility in authoring tools.

The 40 minute video interview gives a good overview of the aim of the research project, while the chat afterwards covers important discussions with prominent accessibility experts as well as the broader community asking questions during the chat in this video.
