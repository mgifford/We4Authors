# Blogs & events

The promotion activities are an important part of the Cluster project with the objectives to reach out to all relevant stakeholders who can directly or indirectly benefit from the project results. The project has been very successful in achieving these goals and has gained a lot of interest. The consortium has been invited to present the project at several conferences and events which have been targeting very specific audiences. The project has also been presented in various articles, interviewed in AXSChat, and got attention in external blogs and newsfeeds.
