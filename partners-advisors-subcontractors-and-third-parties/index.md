# Partners, advisors, subcontractors and third parties

## Consortium

### Funka (project manager)

The knowledge, staff and technology of the non profit was turned into a privately owned company in 2000. Today, we are market leaders in the field of accessibility and enjoy a close relationship to end user organisations, which ensures a unique level of quality control in everything we do.
