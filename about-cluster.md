summary: Background on the We4Authors Cluster pilot project and its focus on accessibility by default.
---

The We4Authors Cluster is an EU-funded pilot project led by Funka with partners across Europe. The team demonstrates how accessibility features can be built into authoring tools so that accessible content is produced by default, especially for public sector publishers.

The cluster collaborates with market-leading vendors, researchers, and accessibility experts to share knowledge, prototype new features, and validate them with real authors. Successful features are released openly to benefit the entire ecosystem of CMS and editor suppliers.

Key goals include:

- Make accessible authoring the default experience in mainstream tools.
- Support public sector authors so they meet the Web Accessibility Directive without extra burden.
- Publish reusable patterns and guidance for vendors and buyers.
