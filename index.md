</div>

Based on a EU-funded pilot project called We4Authors, Funka and its partners make a joint effort to increase the level of accessibility by default in web authoring tools. By sharing knowledge and experience as well as demonstrating how accessibility features can be built into different kinds of tools, we aim to inspire the whole market, focusing on tools used by public sector agencies in the European member states.

The aim is to support web authors, mainly in the public sector, in publishing more accessible content from the start. This way, persons with disabilities are included – and the public sector agencies are complying with the Web Accessibility Directive.

The research is funded by the European Commission and the successful accessibility features will be made public in a repository for the benefit of the community.

## Participate

<div class="callout">
  <p>What if the content management system you are using could produce accessibility by default? Or give you advanced support in publishing accessible content?</p>
  <p>This is your chance to contribute to innovative solutions for the next generation accessible authoring tool.</p>
  <p>Funka is leading user tests with web authors to validate that the new features solve relevant problems, are easy to use, and work well. Testing is planned for October; each session takes about one hour.</p>
